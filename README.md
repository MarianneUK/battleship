# 1. How to Play
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

Where's the Ship? is based on the classic pen-and-paper game Battleships. You can read more about it on this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_%28game%29). 
In this single-player version, the player is asked for their name and a board is automatically generated. The board's spaces are marked with " . " and the shots are marked with " X ".
The player has 5 turns to guess where the ship is. 
After 5 attemps, the game is over.
